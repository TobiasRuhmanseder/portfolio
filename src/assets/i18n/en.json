	"skills text": "In the frontend, I have implemented projects using Angular and TypeScript. I was able to practically apply and deepen key concepts such as state management, routing, and component architecture. I have also worked with RxJS and Firebase. In addition, Scrum was covered in great detail to be well prepared for professional practice.",
	"skills text backend": "In the backend, I have worked with Django and Django REST Framework. There I learned how to build and understand APIs with endpoints, authentication, pagination, and solid database integration. In addition, I acquired basic shell skills and gained practical experience with workers, signals, and Redis. What I especially appreciate is Python’s clean syntax, which made understanding easier for me.",
	"Softskills text": "I bring a broad range of soft skills that define me not only as a developer but also as a true team player. These include empathy, teamwork, and the ability to structure projects and take responsibility. My analytical skills and visionary mindset help me to identify problems early and develop effective solutions. I am committed to continuous learning and always work with order and structure to achieve sustainable results.",
	"skills text devsecops": "Since September 2025, I have been taking part in an intensive DevSecOps training. The content ranges from CI/CD, Linux and container technologies to security testing and compliance. Progress is fast, it is fun, and it gives me valuable practical experience. I am simply excited to cover the entire software lifecycle, and for me, DevSecOps is definitely part of it. That is why I also put a special focus here.",

	"aboutme-hy": "Hello, I am Tobias, an aspiring fullstack developer focusing on Angular & Django. No matter which framework: once you understand the concepts behind it – such as endpoints, authentication, routing or state management – you can quickly work your way into other technologies. That’s exactly what I enjoy: understanding connections, applying them and learning new things. Thanks to my most extensive project so far, Streamflex (a Netflix-like platform), I have gained practical experience in modern technologies such as Angular, Django REST Framework, PostgreSQL, Redis and Docker. I have been studying intensively for almost three years and am currently also deepening my knowledge in the field of DevSecOps.",
	"aboutme-lightbulb": "I have implemented complex web applications, from frontend features in Angular to backend APIs in Django. What I find particularly exciting is how everything works together – databases, authentication, security, tests, CI/CD. For me, it’s not just about coding, but about understanding and applying concepts that also apply in other frameworks.",
	"puzzle": "In addition to technology, I bring more than 10 years of project management experience. I am used to structuring projects, taking responsibility and working solution-oriented in a team. My empathy helps me to recognize problems early, respond to people and find solutions, both on a technical and human level.",

	"streamflex description": "Streamflex is by far my largest fullstack project so far. Here I connected a wide range of technologies, exactly my thing. I’m truly proud of it.",
	"PMAE description":"I felt the urge to develop an app specifically for programming beginners, a tool that makes it easier to get started. Through my almost three-year learning journey, I know exactly what is often missing and what is really needed. During this time, I have collected many notes that now form the foundation. The app will combine project management with a focus on learning and storing knowledge. Links between projects and learning materials will make learning practical and tangible. A knowledge repository will be created that goes far beyond a simple task list. Once my application phase and onboarding are completed, I will work intensively on it in my free time. It will again be a learning-by-doing process, because that is the most effective way to learn. In addition, I want to consciously gain my first experiences with AI tools here, in order to be well prepared for the future in this area as well."
