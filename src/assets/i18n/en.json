	"skills text": "In the frontend, I have implemented projects using Angular and TypeScript. I was able to practically apply and deepen key concepts such as state management, routing, and component architecture. I have also worked with RxJS and Firebase. In addition, Scrum was covered in great detail to be well prepared for professional practice.",
	"skills text backend": "In the backend, I have worked with Django and Django REST Framework. There I learned how to build and understand APIs with endpoints, authentication, pagination, and solid database integration. In addition, I acquired basic shell skills and gained practical experience with workers, signals, and Redis. What I especially appreciate is Python’s clean syntax, which made understanding easier for me.",
	"Softskills text": "For me, soft skills are not just buzzwords, they are part of who I am. During my 17 years of experience in craftsmanship, I learned how to take responsibility, manage projects, and keep a clear mind even in stressful situations. Empathy and teamwork come naturally to me, I enjoy working with people and I find it exciting how different strengths complement each other within a team. At the same time, I approach challenges analytically and focus on finding solutions rather than only seeing problems. Being visionary means to me not only planning the next step but already keeping the step after that in mind. And just as important: staying curious, open to learning, and constantly developing myself.",
	"skills text devsecops": "Since September 2025, I have been enrolled in intensive DevSecOps training. The content ranges from CI/CD, Linux and container technologies to security testing and compliance. Progress is fast, it is fun, and it gives me valuable practical experience. I am simply excited to cover the entire software lifecycle, and for me, DevSecOps is definitely part of it. That is why I also put a special focus here.",

	"aboutme-lightbulb": "I have implemented complex web applications, from frontend features in Angular to backend APIs in Django. What I find particularly exciting is how everything works together – databases, authentication, security, tests, CI/CD. For me, it’s not just about coding, but about understanding and applying concepts that also apply in other frameworks.",
	"puzzle": "In addition to technology, I bring more than 10 years of project management experience. I am used to structuring projects, taking responsibility and working solution-oriented in a team. My empathy helps me to recognize problems early, respond to people and find solutions, both on a technical and human level.",

	"body.me description": "Body.me is a research-informed fitness app designed to combine structured strength training with clear calorie management in a calm and thoughtfully built system. The goal is to make training and nutrition practical and sustainable, without pressure, without complexity, and without unnecessary features. At its core lies a clean training architecture: a workout plan serves as a structured template, while each completed session is stored independently to preserve real progress. The app supports users in creating individualized training structures without overwhelming them with excessive detail. In addition, Body.me offers a simplified and practical approach to calorie and macronutrient management for cutting, bulking, or body recomposition. Instead of overwhelming data analysis, the focus is on clarity, adaptability, and long-term consistency. The system is grounded in established sports science principles such as appropriate weekly volume, progressive overload, and sustainable recovery. Research acts as a foundation for practical guidance, not as a marketing claim. Body.me is not built to control users, but to guide them. A system that builds trust in the process."
